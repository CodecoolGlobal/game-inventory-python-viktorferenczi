# - None (by default) means the table is unordered
# - "count,desc" means the table is ordered by count (of items in the inventory) 
#   in descending order

# The filename comes as an argument, but by default it's

# if the filename argument is None it creates and overwrites a file
# called "export_inventory.csv". The file format is the same plain text 
# with comma separated values (CSV).
